# odin-recipes 
A rudimentary website about french recipes , with 1 main page and 3 recipe page  

This project demonstrate my ability to create a structured rudimentary website ,
it contains 4 pages including the index and each page is linked to one another for easy access.
Each page contain relative and at the exception of the index page , absolute links .
They also include images . 

I'll come back to this project after having a bit more experience under my belt to improve upon it and make it look cool.
